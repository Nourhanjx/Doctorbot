# Health DocBot
- Developed at Microsoft Hackathon

## Inspiration
Wouldn't it be awesome if you could have a Doctor in your pocket?

## What it does
DoctorBot is a chatbot who listens to your symptoms, asks follow up questions, and attempts to diagnose the problem. DoctorBot can also guide you to your nearest hospital.

## How we built it
- Backend: Python + Flask hosted on Heroku
- Frontend: Facebook Messenger Chatbot
- Medical Information: Infermedica API
- Hospital/Clinic location Information: Foursquare venue API
- Hospictal/Clinic location Sharing: Google Static Maps API
- NLP stuff: API.ai (didn't quite work as planned :P )

## Challenges we ran into
Figuring out how a bot works, trying to connect Kenzen Hardware (add patient vitals) to the bot. Preparing a good user experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We actually made it work! (Well, more or less)

## What's next for SlideBack
- Using location data to detect common trends in an area (e.g. alot of people in Bangalore have the flu)
- Improving the NLP part
